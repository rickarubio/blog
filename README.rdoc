Hello! I was following along with this RailsGuide:
http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html

A working blog! Woohoo! :-)

Username is just
Password is testing

for posting.

First experience with anything db related, so this was pretty cool.

I don't understand everything I typed in, but I have a greater understanding of Rails than when I started this tutorial a couple hours ago. Win!
